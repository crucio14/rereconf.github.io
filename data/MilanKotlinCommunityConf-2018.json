	"tags": ["kotlin","java"],
    "language": "en",
	"abstract": "Thanks to Android Studio it’s really easy to introduce Kotlin in an existing project, the configuration is trivial and then we can convert Java classes to Kotlin using a Alt+Shift+Cmd+K. But the new syntax is the just beginning, using Kotlin we can improve our code making it more readable and simpler to write.In this talk we’ll see how to use some Kotlin features (for example data classes, collections, coroutines and delegates) to simplify Android development comparing the code with the equivalent “modern” Java code. It’s not fair to compare Kotlin code with plain Java 6 code so the Java examples will use lambdas and some external libraries like RxJava and AutoValue."
