This live coding talk will show you how to add Elasticsearch to your legacy application without changing all your current development habits. Your application will suddenly have advanced search features, all without the need to write complex SQL code! David will start from a RestX, Hibernate and Postgresql/MySQL based application and will add a complete integration of Elasticsearch, all live from the stage during his presentation."

    "abstract": "In this demo, we're going to build a crowd-controlled game with Elixir and Phoenix. Elixir is a young and exciting language based on the battle-tested Erlang and Phoenix is an Elixir framework for the modern web. With these tools, we're gonna be able to create a fault-tolerant, scalable, real-time game that the audience will be able to control from their browser: everyone at the same time, of course! In the process (pun intended, you'll get it after the demo!), we're gonna learn the basics of Elixir and Erlang, get excited about how cool they are, have a look at Phoenix, and discuss more serious things that can be done with these technologies, such as making a ton of fault-tolerant, scalable, real-time money!"

    "abstract": "Modeling and querying persistent data structures can be tricky when they involve semi-structured data, complex relationships (with deep traversal) and physical information like geographical positions, areas, shapes and so on. Bad news is that almost all modern applications have to manage such kind of data. In this session we will see how to use OrientDB v2.2 Document-Graph engine and its new Geospatial Indexes to efficiently manage and query connected, spatial information. Of course we will also display these data on an Angular2+GoogleMaps front-end."

    "abstract": "oVirt is a virtualization platform with an easy-to-use web interface. It manages virtual machines, storage and virtualized networks and makes KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) a viable feature-rich, enterprise-class virtualization alternative. oVirt provides a set of REST APIs for:\n- Infrastructure configuration\n- Host configuration and management\n- Network and storage configuration\n- Virtual machine (VM) configuration and management\n- Networking for the Guest, Virtual disks, VM properties\n- User management\n- Daily maintenance and VM lifecycle management\n\nThe APIs can be used:\n- As way to integrate with other software used in the organization\n- For automation of tasks (provisioning and management Software development)\n- For scripting and utilities\n\nMore over, this could be integrated with other tools like cloud-init or Ansible to configure you specific VMs and build your open infrastructure as code stack. The oVirt REST APIs can be directly accessed (RSDL is also available) and Java, Python and Ruby SDK are also available. In this session we'll see:\n- how to access oVirt with the python SDK\n- how to dynamically create and start a new VM on an oVirt infrastructure from our code checking capabilities and available resources\n- how to initially configure the new VM via cloudInit\n- how to manage it with Ansible"

    "abstract": "As the Web has shown, hypermedia messages over HTTP are an elegant and flexible way of building applications. The HTTP infrastructure simplifies your application protocol and gives you caching and scalability essentially for free. Hypermedia messages give dynamic control over the application state transitions, allowing to grow applications and change things around without breaking clients. These are terrific properties! In this talk, I'll put these claims to the test as we play, dissecting and extending an old-school text adventure game implemented using nothing but HTTP and hypermedia."
